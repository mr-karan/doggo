---

**doggo** is a modern command-line DNS client (like _dig_) written in Golang. It outputs information in a neat concise manner and supports protocols like DoH, DoT, DoQ, and DNSCrypt as well.

It's totally inspired by [dog](https://github.com/ogham/dog/) which is written in Rust. I wanted to add some features to it but since I don't know Rust, I found it as a nice opportunity to experiment with writing a DNS Client from scratch in `Go` myself. Hence the name `dog` + `go` => **doggo**.
